# motor-stepper-control-by-51-
this is a project about control
this is a project about use MCS-51 series MCU to control motor stepper,main compiled by c.and it can show the stepper's situation by LED-light,with the ability to make the motor run counterclockwise and clock wise by button,about the electric part we use proteus you can learn fro our project and you enen can discuss with me about the detail.it suit foe the green hand to learn,hope it can help you my friends.
中文说明：这是一个关于使用51系列单片机控制步进电机的工程文件，编程语言为c，使用Proteus来搭建电路图。适合作为单片机初学者学习，在此开放给大家（同文在中文互联网平台亦有发布）
